# Contribution Guidelines

Have you just found a spelling error? Need to fix indentation?
Send us a [Pull Request][pr] :sparkles:

If you have discovered something cool, but don't know exactly if it suits the
awesome definition submit a [Pull Request][pr] to the [inbox](inbox.md).
We'll consider your addition and format it for you in the [main list](readme.md) :smiley:

If you know something pretty cool, it suits the awesome definition, works for you
and seems to be useful for the community please [add][pr] it to the [main list](readme.md).
In this case please ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

- Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
- Adhere to the existing formatting rules.
- Use the following format: `- [title](link) - Description. <sup>[Additional info]</sup>`
- Break down long lines.
- Check your spelling, grammar, capitalization, and punctuation.
- Name the tools and libraries exactly how they are required from the Ruby
  program, not after the Readme's title, e.g. `treat`, not `Treat`, since you
  do `require "treat"`.
- Add everything to the bottom of the relevant category.
- Provide a description on why this stuff is useful (distinctive features like
  coverage, speed, stability are welcome).
- Introduce new categories or improve the existing categorization.
- Remove trailing whitespaces.
- Provide a useful title and comments for your Pull Request (not `Changed readme.md`).
- Mention the originator in the PR message, e.g.
  `Added the neuroevo lib by @giuse.`
- Add the topic `rubyml` to your repository or open an issue and
  kindly ask the originator of the project to do so (if applicable for your submission).

Sometimes we will ask you to edit your Pull Request before it is included.
This is normally due to spelling errors or because your PR didn't match
these guidelines.

[Here][change-pr] is a write up on how to change a Pull Request and
the different ways you can do that.

:+1: Thank you for your suggestions!
