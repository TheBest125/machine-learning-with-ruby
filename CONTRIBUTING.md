# Contribution Guidelines

You can contribute to this list in three ways. But please read about
our [motivation](motivation.md) on this curated collection first.

## Adding and Idea to the [Inbox](inbox.md)

If you have found a library, resource, collection etc, but not used it
extensively, you can submit a Pull Request to the [Inbox](inbox.md). We'll consider
your submission and decide if it can be useful in the ML context.

## Adding to the main list
If you know something pretty cool, it suits the awesome definition, works for you
and seems to be useful for the community please add it to the main list.
Provide a description on why it is useful (distinctive features like coverage,
speed, stability are welcome).

## Working on the list infrastructure
Like everybody we have a lot to do. Please help us to maintain this list and it's
infrastructure. In the [todo](todo.md) file you'll find some ideas how and what
to change in this list.

## How to add to this list

Please ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

- Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
- Use the following format: `- [title](link) - Description.`
  Note the capitalization and punctuation. Name the tools and libraries exactly
  how they are required from the Ruby programs, not after the Readme's title, e.g.
  `treat`, not `Treat`, since you do `require "treat"`.
- Link additions should be added to the bottom of the relevant category.
- New categories or improvements to the existing categorization are welcome.
- Check your spelling and grammar.
- Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace.
- The pull request and commit should have a useful title.

Thank you for your suggestions!

## Updating your Pull Request
Sometimes, we will ask you to edit your Pull Request before it is included.
This is normally due to spelling errors or because your PR didn't match
these guidelines.

[Here](https://github.com/RichardLitt/knowledge/blob/master/amending-a-commit-guide.md)
is a write up on how to change a Pull Request, and the different ways you can do that.
